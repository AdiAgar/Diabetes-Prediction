## About

Our repository houses a state-of-the-art diabetes prediction model, trained on a comprehensive dataset of health parameters such as age, BMI, blood pressure, and glucose levels. Our model utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms to provide highly accurate predictions, making it an invaluable tool for healthcare professionals seeking to identify patients at risk of developing diabetes and providing them with targeted interventions.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: We have developed a streamlined, user-friendly interface for data input and analysis, making it easy for both professionals and individuals to use.

- **Detailed Documentation**: Our repository includes detailed documentation and examples to help users get up and running quickly. You'll find instructions on how to use the web app effectively.

- **Data Visualization**: We have implemented powerful data visualization tools to facilitate understanding of the factors that contribute to the prediction. Visualizations help users interpret the model's predictions and gain insights into the data.

## Stack Used

Our web app is built using Python and leverages the following Python libraries:

- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/): Used for building and training the machine learning model.
- [pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html): Used for model persistence.
- [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/): Used for creating the web app interface.
